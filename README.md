# Code Validator Project

Code Validator is one of the most recent project I made. Everything started, once again at my high school, we got every course an exercice to give back in python. However, being a class of around 25 students, the professor has to go over each program, open the mail, download it, open it, read it, evaluate etc... And making it one time is ok, but making it 25 times at each class is long and boring. So this application is a problem solver, the goal is the make easier for the student to give back the exercices and make it easier for the professors to evaluate the level of the students. I also know my code isn't perfect and I know there are still some bugs out here and I know some things could have been better.

# The stack

For the front-end I used NextJS as the framework, Typescript as the language and TailwindCSS as the styling library. On another hand, on the back-end, I made a GraphQL api using Apollo Server. Used a SQL database as Sequelize for ORM and using MariaDB or MySQL depending on the OS I was working on. There is not that much more to tell about the stack.

Project made by, **Lukas Laudrain**.
